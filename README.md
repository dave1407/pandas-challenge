-Summary of the report-


Based on the data analysis we are presenting, one can definetly confirm that the numbers show that Private schools are still a better option compared to District Schools.

However, education is not just about spending money. As you can notice on this analysis, spending more money in average per student does not reflect on having better performance, it actualy worsens.

Actually, the data shows that the school with the best performance, has one of the lowest budget per student.

It is worth to notice though, that the general population is still having issues with Math, Reading seems to be a subject where students have better performance.
